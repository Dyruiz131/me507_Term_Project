# ME507 Fall 2022 Project: Chessbot

The project aims to allow an online user play on a physical board against somebody playing on the board in-person.

The controller website for the board can be found here:

https://me507-chessbot.netlify.app

**The website only controls the white side of the board.**

The website controls a custom built API, which the ESP32 communicates with to manage changes to the board.

The webserver project can be found here:
