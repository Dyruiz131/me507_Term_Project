# ME507 Fall 2022 Project: Chessbot

## Introduction
The project aims to allow two online users to play against each other on a robotically controlled board.

## Webserver
The webserver project can be found here:
[ME507-ChessBotServer](https://github.com/sam-hud/ME507-ChessBotServer)

The controller website for the board can accessed [here](https://me507-chessbot.netlify.app).

The website controls a custom built API, which the ESP32 communicates with to manage changes to the board.
