# ME507 Fall 2022 Project: Chessbot

The project aims to allow two online users to play against each other on a robotically controlled board.

The controller website for the board can be found here:

https://me507-chessbot.netlify.app

The website controls a custom built API, which the ESP32 communicates with to manage changes to the board.

The webserver project can be found here:
